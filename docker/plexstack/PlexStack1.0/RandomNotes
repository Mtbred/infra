PlexStack VM information
  - server IP 192.168.2.46
  - MAC address that is set to static in router 22:90:66:bf:72:7c

I have an nfs share mounted on the PlexStack box
  - It is done by adding this line to the end of the /etc/fstab:
  - 192.168.2.23:/mnt/Primary_Pool/Linux/data /data nfs default 0 0

This configuration requires an acme.json file to be created at:
  - /data/config/traefik/acme.json
  - This file needs to be chmod to 600 before running docker-compose up -d

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
missing information for the configuration:
  need to write out the configs for all the docker containers
  because I may need to redo them following the migration to docker 2.X?
  but it also will just be beneficial to have in general
